     I received a reply on 4 April from Alison McCarthy to my request for
information about a development grant (SIC Code 7220) to Vero International
Software UK Limited which is unfortunately not satisfactory.
    I requested all details about this grant in terms of its application and
any reports done afterwards.  In order to facilitate my understanding as to the
degree of accountability regarding this grants, I need to see all documents
held by the Regional Development Agency which could possibly provide evidence
that the project outlined actually existed, and that the money wasn't simply
absorbed into shareholder profit.
    It would be entirely fair to redact all trade secrets and confidential
information from the documents as they are disclosed, but I do not believe it
is reasonable to withhold disclosure of even their titles, dates and number of
pages.

It's terribly slow.
Clear out all the need admin attention requests
Clear out all the need classifying requests

https://secure.mysociety.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=1032

This infers the wrong calculated state due to followups
https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/foi/request/show/619

In flow, encourage people to make new requests rather than file new requests as
follow ups on existing one.

Show similar requests after you have filed yours - maybe on preview too.

Advertise WDTK search queries on TWFY
Advertise alerts on end pages with WDTK

Internal review status/marker?
Request withdrawn by user status/marker?

Redo the RSS feeds

Antispam on contact form
Incoming email to unknown FOI is a bit rubbish

Do something about shared spreadsheet

Blog posts / Wikipedia articles about this request
    e.g. http://socialreporter.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/costs-of-the-bbc-action-action-network/
    http://reportr.net/2008/04/24/bbc-spent-6m-to-develop-the-iplayer/
Or just look at referrers as Julian says

In sidebar of request 
    Share this request on Facebook, by email etc.
    Email icon here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/apr/03/mugabe
    Simple Digg style "I lke this request" button (doesn't tracking do?)
Show list of popular tracks somewhere (finds most popular requests in a way)

user/show.rhtml sidebar vs. generic sidebar? (ask Tommy)
Needs tagline that v. quickly explains what site is on each page

Later
=====

Alert you when someone you're tracking starts tracking another request

Catch query parser error, e.g. for this query
    water NOT NEAR "water lane"
Document such errors in acts_as_xapian

It's looking very nice!  I had a look at the M27 request, as per your
earlier email, but I was a bit thrown by the date - is it the 27th
today, or last week, or more recently.  Do you think it would be
worthwhile appending "($days days ago)" to the date of each message,
and "($days days to go)" to the due dates?  Saves people having to
work out (in their heads or otherwise) how long they need to wait for
a response. (Etienne)

Maybe set it up to email team@ website errors?

Renaming public authorities will break alerts on them.

Display current page (when not on first page), or perhaps range on both the
/list pages, and on the /..../similar pages (maybe I missed it elsewhere too).
Should make a general will_paginate like function to do this part, and call
that from /search (which has this already) too.

Check this again after a while, for dodgy states of events:
s = InfoRequest.find(:all).select { |i| (not i.awaiting_description) and i.get_last_response_event_id and InfoRequestEvent.find(i.get_last_response_event_id).calculated_state != i.described_state }; s.size
- XXXX so when somebody changes waiting description without changing described state doesn't log in event.

Edits to outgoing/incoming/title won't be reindexed in Xapian (maybe just reindex all once a week)
And maybe edits to prominence, which is more upsetting
Never updates cached attachment text unless cache is explicitly cleared (which
might matter with software updates, or code changes)

Link more clearly to full request and next/previous correspondence (ask Matthew)
    Perhaps always redirect to internal # links from the /response/ pages
e.g. http://www.flickr.com/groups/central/discuss/72157604494352123/72157604515433851/

Get Atom highlighting to include stylesheet for yellow somehow
When you click RSS feed when on own request, default to RSS in the choice on next page
Offer option of a feed with the union of all your feeds (tartarus asked for this).

Just make RSS normal like on other sites rather than something you have to
register for.

"Some of the information" option should give you choice of complaining if you like.

Offer search on 404s

Rate limit requests using Ratty, with a freeze thing WTT-style, to detect
vexatious requests.

Preview when sending followups - especially people need to see quoting/subject
When sending "my response is late"

Interface for when you change your email address - easier to do now with post_redirect.circumstance?

Tell application developer if working days table not up to date, and needs
updating

Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses, now we have remember me

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Properly escape all name_and_email functions

Give hotline to call body for extra help
e.g. Advice and assistance in making FoI requests to the House of Lords is available

Lords. London SW1A 0PW. Telephone 020 7219 0100. E-mail: foilords@parliament.uk
http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/freedom_of_information_in_the_house_of_lords/lords__foi___how_to_obtain_information.cfm

Including 'Request for information' in the subject line of your e-mail will assist us in prioritising your request.
http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/freedom_of_information_in_the_house_of_lords/lords__foi___how_to_obtain_information.cfm
XXX do we need specifically that text, is it better than "Freedom of Information request" which we put now?
Medway also hint at this with subject= on mailto link

Remove request email address from PDFs (we already do from docs)
   http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cost_of_policing_the_oxford_unio_3
   - maybe if text contains email, refuse to show full PDF just show conversion
     to text/HTML?
