OK, so we could index status of requests... But then there are two problems:
1) Have to somehow reindex when a request becomes overdue.
2) The Email/RSS won't work that well, as it uses created date as a filter,
which won't work for when there is no event.

http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/details_of_grant_awarded_to_vi_g_
     I received a reply on 4 April from Alison McCarthy to my request for
information about a development grant (SIC Code 7220) to Vero International
Software UK Limited which is unfortunately not satisfactory.
    I requested all details about this grant in terms of its application and
any reports done afterwards.  In order to facilitate my understanding as to the
degree of accountability regarding this grants, I need to see all documents
held by the Regional Development Agency which could possibly provide evidence
that the project outlined actually existed, and that the money wasn't simply
absorbed into shareholder profit.
    It would be entirely fair to redact all trade secrets and confidential
information from the documents as they are disclosed, but I do not believe it
is reasonable to withhold disclosure of even their titles, dates and number of
pages.

Please send me all documentation relating to the decision to use results from
the Oxford Economic Forecasting's report "The Economic Contribution of the
Aviation Industry in the UK" in the "Air Transport White Paper Progress Report
 2006"

Things to track:
    - new requests
    - new requests with keyword
    - successful responses
described_at is needed for Users and Public Bodies for RSS

Fix search to deal with overdue message query that Tomski asks for


Later
=====

Put user rather than import_csv

Link more clearly to full request and next/previous correspondence (ask Matthew)
    Perhaps always redirect to internal # links from the /response/ pages
e.g. http://www.flickr.com/groups/central/discuss/72157604494352123/72157604515433851/

Get Atom highlighting to include stylesheet for yellow somehow
When you click RSS feed when on own request, default to RSS in the choice on next page

"Some of the information" option should give you choice of complaining if you like.

Offer search on 404s

Search and replace text "FOI" and "Freedom of Information" out the way more
 - but put it in the title tag

Send email to remind people to clarify

This search gives a runtime error:
    "19 hours

Preview when sending followups - especially people need to see quoting/subject
when sending "my response is late"

Change email address interface - easier to do now with post_redirect.circumstance?

One of the PDFs on live site has:
Error: PDF version 1.6 -- xpdf supports version 1.5 (continuing anyway)
Need to upgrade to poppler-utils?

Add lots more UNIQUE indices

Merge workflow into one stream - find information, if you can't find it then request it.
    so just search is on front page, with popular stuff below a la Google Directory

in sidebar of request 
    Link to WriteToThem - according to level of Government of body
    Start a petition about this request
    Share this request on Facebook

Tell application developer if working days table not up to date, and needs
updating

Response overdue alerts (NOT TRACKS - this is old style alerts to requester)
are only sent first time a request goes into that state :( Store id in alert of
last event which resets the due date

Overdue response events, so track alerts / RSS picks up when response is late

Overdue response alert email click through should show how many days overdue
    it is near where you write your reply

Consider on staging sites making follow ups go to dummy address also

Remember me box
    This can't possible be the best way, it is too depressing:
    http://onrails.org/articles/2006/02/18/auto-login
Then consider removing login links from notifications of new responses

Screen scrape this and add link to it on the public body page

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed
