Request withdrawn by user status/marker?

Perhaps encourage user to annotate what they learnt after getting information?
When they say "successful", encourage them to make an annotation?
"Some of the information" option should give you choice of complaining if you like.

Clear out all the need admin attention requests

CSS things
    - CSS error on "all councils" page on some browsers
    - Spacing on error boxes round form elements
    - icons for "Things to do with this request" ?

Merge workflow into one stream - find information, if you can't find it then request it.
Show similar requests after you have filed yours - maybe on preview too.
Fit google search and website search better into flow somehow, but how :(

Add "I have a large file" to FOI office FAQ
Add "Who should I make my request to?"
Add "I want to file squillions of requests"
Add "I didn't get the email / spam question" and link to from FOI offcier upload page
Add "Postal replies stuff" and link to from FOI officer upload page
Add "I'm not sure which authority to make my request to" - make flow better after first section, to abrupt now

Grrr - so here I wanted to clarify my request, but don't want the timer to be reset!
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/online_petitions_documents_from#incoming-3248

Write code to make sure the Return-Path is never foi@sandwich.org.uk (even if the
  Rails code breaks for Sendmail case in future botched Rails upgrades :)

Admin:
    Somehow fold up the enormous pages on many admin pages
    Have internal links to different parts of request page

Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses, now we have remember me


Later
=====

Test code for FOI officer upload

Detect councils that always send automatic acknowledgements, and notice if they
do not for a particular request? (e.g. Leicestershire County Council)

Do conversion tracking on endpoints in WDTK, advertise perhaps TWFY, or perhaps
    donations to mySociety.

http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/list/successful - too many ombudsmans.
    Radical would be to group by user, regardless of subject; less radical to
    collate those with same/similar subject.
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/list?page=2 - too many monitoring officer
    reports - similar to above, I reckon.

favicon.ico would be nice

Protect from CSRF with this in app controller (care it doesn't break anything):
  # See ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection for details
    # Uncomment the :secret if you're not using the cookie session store
      protect_from_forgery # :secret => '<%= app_secret %>'

Look at quote_address_if_necessary in actionmailer's quoting.rb - why did it
not work for the email address with "@" in its name part?

Search FAQ and other help pages with normal search
    - also the "notes" section on an authority

Jump to a random request :)

VSD files vsdump - example in zip file
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/dog_control_orders#incoming-3510
    doing file RESPONSE/Internal documents/Briefing with Contact Islington/Contact Islington Flowchart Jul 08.vsd content type 
Search for other extensions that we have now
    (call IncomingMessage.find_all_unknown_mime_types to find them)

From an email, isn't stripping spaces right.
    "Met Office  sent a response to Andrew Montford (14 August 2008)"
Also should group by the request id for search queries (so all appear
together when request and response mention same term)

Link the overdue date to an explanation of what bank holidays it skipped etc.
:)

When indexing .docx do you need to index docProps/custom.xml and docProps/app.xml
as well as word/document.xml ? (thread on xapian-discuss does so)

Something to check which tags are used but aren't in PublicBody category lists

When described state is edited in admin interface, automatically reset the flag
for needs classification.

Public body tags should perhaps be forced to be lowercase only :)

In sidebar of request 
    Share this request on Facebook, by email etc.
    Email icon here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/apr/03/mugabe
    Simple Digg style "I like this request" button 
Show list of popular tracks somewhere (finds most popular requests in a way)

Advertise WDTK search queries on TWFY
Advertise alerts on end pages with WDTK

Blog posts / Wikipedia articles about this request
    e.g. http://socialreporter.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/costs-of-the-bbc-action-action-network/
    http://reportr.net/2008/04/24/bbc-spent-6m-to-develop-the-iplayer/
Or just look at referrers as Julian says

Catch query parser error, e.g. for this query
    water NOT NEAR "water lane"
Document such errors in acts_as_xapian

It's looking very nice!  I had a look at the M27 request, as per your
earlier email, but I was a bit thrown by the date - is it the 27th
today, or last week, or more recently.  Do you think it would be
worthwhile appending "($days days ago)" to the date of each message,
and "($days days to go)" to the due dates?  Saves people having to
work out (in their heads or otherwise) how long they need to wait for
a response. (Etienne) Use distance_of_time_in_words to do this

Renaming public authorities will break alerts on them.

Compress the emails in the database
Don't store the cached text in backups

Check this again after a while, for dodgy states of events:
s = InfoRequest.find(:all).select { |i| (not i.awaiting_description) and i.get_last_response_event_id and InfoRequestEvent.find(i.get_last_response_event_id).calculated_state != i.described_state }; s.size
- XXXX so when somebody changes waiting description without changing described state doesn't log in event.

Edits to outgoing/incoming/title won't be reindexed in Xapian (maybe just reindex all once a week)
    And maybe edits to prominence, which is more upsetting
    Never updates cached attachment text unless cache is explicitly cleared (which
    might matter with software updates, or code changes)
This does it all:
$ ./script/clear-incoming-text-cache ; ./script/rebuild-xapian-index

Get Atom highlighting to include stylesheet for yellow somehow

For followups, have radio button to say is it a new request or followup?

Interface for when you change your email address - easier to do now with post_redirect.circumstance?

Tell application developer if working days table not up to date, and needs
updating

Synthesise these tips into our handful of snappy snappy bullet points
    http://community.foe.co.uk/tools/right_to_know/tips.html
    http://www.justice.gov.uk/requestinginformation.htm

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Properly escape all name_and_email functions
    call our new TMail.Address.encode_quoted_string monkeypatch function

Including 'Request for information' in the subject line of your e-mail will assist us in prioritising your request.
http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/freedom_of_information_in_the_house_of_lords/lords__foi___how_to_obtain_information.cfm
XXX do we need specifically that text, is it better than "Freedom of Information request" which we put now?
Medway also hint at this with subject= on mailto link

Remove request email address from PDFs (we already do from docs)
   http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cost_of_policing_the_oxford_unio_3
   - maybe if text contains email, refuse to show full PDF just show conversion
     to text/HTML?
