Grrr - so here I wanted to clarify my request, but don't want the timer to be reset!
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/online_petitions_documents_from#incoming-3248
Perhaps encourage user to annotate what they learnt after getting information?

Clear out all the need admin attention requests
Clear out all the need classifying requests

When forcing auth user for followups is a bit confusing/weird, does it really work?
    Perhaps remove signout dialog and have signin instead?
    Should we say auth for followups sooner as you have to be certain user?
Display of login dialog to log in as particular user if you are logged out isn't centred nicely

Admin:
    Have internal links to different parts of request page
    Somehow fold up the enormous pages on many admin pages

Comments etc. do not sort in right order - by date, but not by time

"Excessive use of speed by Police vehicles." appears only once, even though multiple annotations.
Perhaps show grouping count?
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/search/variety:comment/newest

Try changing "email me" link to something else like "track by email"

CSS things
    - CSS error on "all councils" page on some browsers
    - Need Icon for annotations in search results
    - Icon for government departments is too Parliamentary

Merge workflow into one stream - find information, if you can't find it then request it.
    so just search is on front page, with popular stuff below a la Google Directory
Shamefully your incremental search, make it as nice as Matthew's i.e. 
    - have actual space in layout for full list rather than pop down.
    - show things beginning with the term first, separated visually
    - highlight the parts which match
Google search within website of authority.
Show similar requests after you have filed yours - maybe on preview too.
Use spelling correction for public bodies search (in addition to substring?)

Flag bad comments, delete comments from admin interface


Later

Search FAQ and other help pages with normal search
    - also the "notes" section on an authority

Jump to a random request :)

Search for other extensions that we have now
    (call IncomingMessage.find_all_unknown_mime_types to find them)

From an email, isn't stripping spaces right.
    "Met Office  sent a response to Andrew Montford (14 August 2008)"
Also should group by the request id for search queries (so all appear
together when request and response mention same term)

This doesn't work:
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/search/status:waiting_classification/

Link the overdue date to an explanation of what bank holidays it skipped etc.
:)

When indexing .docx do you need to index docProps/custom.xml and docProps/app.xml
as well as word/document.xml ? (thread on xapian-discuss does so)

Something to check which tags are used but aren't in PublicBody category lists

When described state is edited in admin interface, automatically reset the flag
for needs classification.

Public body tags should perhaps be forced to be lowercase only :)

In sidebar of request 
    Share this request on Facebook, by email etc.
    Email icon here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/apr/03/mugabe
    Simple Digg style "I lke this request" button (doesn't tracking do?)
Show list of popular tracks somewhere (finds most popular requests in a way)

Advertise WDTK search queries on TWFY
Advertise alerts on end pages with WDTK

Blog posts / Wikipedia articles about this request
    e.g. http://socialreporter.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/costs-of-the-bbc-action-action-network/
    http://reportr.net/2008/04/24/bbc-spent-6m-to-develop-the-iplayer/
Or just look at referrers as Julian says

Catch query parser error, e.g. for this query
    water NOT NEAR "water lane"
Document such errors in acts_as_xapian

It's looking very nice!  I had a look at the M27 request, as per your
earlier email, but I was a bit thrown by the date - is it the 27th
today, or last week, or more recently.  Do you think it would be
worthwhile appending "($days days ago)" to the date of each message,
and "($days days to go)" to the due dates?  Saves people having to
work out (in their heads or otherwise) how long they need to wait for
a response. (Etienne) Use distance_of_time_in_words to do this

Renaming public authorities will break alerts on them.

Compress the emails in the database
Don't store the cached text in backups

Display current page (when not on first page), or perhaps range on both the
/list pages, and on the /..../similar pages (maybe I missed it elsewhere too).
Should make a general will_paginate like function to do this part, and call
that from /search (which has this already) too.
Paginate request listing (and other things!) on user page, and on public
authority page.  
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/user/stuart_hardwicke_carruthers

Check this again after a while, for dodgy states of events:
s = InfoRequest.find(:all).select { |i| (not i.awaiting_description) and i.get_last_response_event_id and InfoRequestEvent.find(i.get_last_response_event_id).calculated_state != i.described_state }; s.size
- XXXX so when somebody changes waiting description without changing described state doesn't log in event.

Edits to outgoing/incoming/title won't be reindexed in Xapian (maybe just reindex all once a week)
    And maybe edits to prominence, which is more upsetting
    Never updates cached attachment text unless cache is explicitly cleared (which
    might matter with software updates, or code changes)
This does it all:
$ ./script/clear-incoming-text-cache ; ./script/rebuild-xapian-index

Get Atom highlighting to include stylesheet for yellow somehow
Offer option of one RSS feed with all things you are tracking in it. Maybe.

"Some of the information" option should give you choice of complaining if you like.

Offer search on 404s

For followups, have radio button to say is it a new request or followup?

Interface for when you change your email address - easier to do now with post_redirect.circumstance?

Tell application developer if working days table not up to date, and needs
updating

Synthesise these tips into our handful of snappy snappy bullet points
    http://community.foe.co.uk/tools/right_to_know/tips.html
    http://www.justice.gov.uk/requestinginformation.htm

Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses, now we have remember me

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Properly escape all name_and_email functions
    call our new TMail.Address.encode_quoted_string monkeypatch function

Including 'Request for information' in the subject line of your e-mail will assist us in prioritising your request.
http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/freedom_of_information_in_the_house_of_lords/lords__foi___how_to_obtain_information.cfm
XXX do we need specifically that text, is it better than "Freedom of Information request" which we put now?
Medway also hint at this with subject= on mailto link

Remove request email address from PDFs (we already do from docs)
   http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cost_of_policing_the_oxford_unio_3
   - maybe if text contains email, refuse to show full PDF just show conversion
     to text/HTML?

Antispam on contact form

Find a way to get corrected email addresses from responses - somehow getting
user to send them in?  
e.g. as in http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/1071/response/1870 which
we found largely by accident.

Rate limit requests using Ratty, with a freeze thing WTT-style, to detect
vexatious requests.

Editable user profile, including photo upload

HTML versions of all attachments, so links like in GMail
    Somthing.doc
        20K   View as HTML   Open as a Google document   Download

.tif files are hard for people to view as multi page, consider automatically
separating out the pages as separate links (to .png files or whatever)
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/windsor_maidenhead_council_commo#incoming-1910
Heck, may as well give thumbnails of all images, indeed all docs while you're at it :)

   and convert Word Docs to PDFs too

Add geographical location to council import
Have a single button to sign up to alerts on all your council PCTs etc.
