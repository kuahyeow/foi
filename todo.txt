     I received a reply on 4 April from Alison McCarthy to my request for
information about a development grant (SIC Code 7220) to Vero International
Software UK Limited which is unfortunately not satisfactory.
    I requested all details about this grant in terms of its application and
any reports done afterwards.  In order to facilitate my understanding as to the
degree of accountability regarding this grants, I need to see all documents
held by the Regional Development Agency which could possibly provide evidence
that the project outlined actually existed, and that the money wasn't simply
absorbed into shareholder profit.
    It would be entirely fair to redact all trade secrets and confidential
information from the documents as they are disclosed, but I do not believe it
is reasonable to withhold disclosure of even their titles, dates and number of
pages.

Please send me all documentation relating to the decision to use results from
the Oxford Economic Forecasting's report "The Economic Contribution of the
Aviation Industry in the UK" in the "Air Transport White Paper Progress Report
 2006"

Or just look at referrers as Julian says

Test: In email alerts, show request heading somewhere

Add test code for search track emails
    and also highling in RSS

Check test code coverage again - do we have all models

Reconsider described vs. newest for the tracks

Fix up the privacy policy

Advertise WDTK search queries on TWFY
Show popular tracks somewhere (on admin, or not!)

Later
=====

Bit confusing that sort order when you do "variety:successful" in query is by the date of creation.
Should probably use the described date a lot more often for dates. But not sure, hard to tell.

HTML in Atom feed ask Tommy about it

Check this again after a while, for dodgy states of events:
s = InfoRequest.find(:all).select { |i| (not i.awaiting_description) and i.get_last_response_event_id and InfoRequestEvent.find(i.get_last_response_event_id).calculated_state != i.described_state }; s.size

Museum aliases

Highlight text search finds in word docs
Edits to outgoing/incoming/title won't be reindexed in Xapian (maybe just reindex all once a week)

Make the "needs admin attention" have a text box asking why

Internet explorer bug with HTML for Elena
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/_the_infection_rates_of_orthopae

Put name of admin user rather than import_csv

Link more clearly to full request and next/previous correspondence (ask Matthew)
    Perhaps always redirect to internal # links from the /response/ pages
e.g. http://www.flickr.com/groups/central/discuss/72157604494352123/72157604515433851/

Get Atom highlighting to include stylesheet for yellow somehow
When you click RSS feed when on own request, default to RSS in the choice on next page

"Some of the information" option should give you choice of complaining if you like.

Offer search on 404s

Send email to remind people to clarify

Preview when sending followups - especially people need to see quoting/subject
when sending "my response is late"

Interface for when you change your email address - easier to do now with post_redirect.circumstance?

One of the PDFs on live site has:
Error: PDF version 1.6 -- xpdf supports version 1.5 (continuing anyway)
Need to upgrade to poppler-utils?

Merge workflow into one stream - find information, if you can't find it then request it.
    so just search is on front page, with popular stuff below a la Google Directory
Use spelling correction for public bodies search?

In sidebar of request 
    Link to WriteToThem according to level of Government of body
    Share this request on Facebook etc.
    Email icon here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/apr/03/mugabe

Tell application developer if working days table not up to date, and needs
updating

Response overdue alerts (NOT TRACKS - this is old style alerts to requester)
are only sent first time a request goes into that state :( Store id in alert of
last event which resets the due date

Overdue response alert email click through should show how many days overdue
    it is near where you write your reply

Remove staging site stuff, and making the banner a not www.whatdotheyknow.com
banner

Synthesise these tips into our handful of snappy snappy bullet points
    http://community.foe.co.uk/tools/right_to_know/tips.html
    http://www.justice.gov.uk/requestinginformation.htm

Only show "is email right" footer the first time a new request is sent to that
email?
Show public body email address on their public page, with a link to say "this isn't right!"

CSV export of lists of emails for admins

Requests with related content 
    - via a compare document search somehow?
    - using the tracking requests network

Remember me box
    This can't possible be the best way, it is too depressing:
    http://onrails.org/articles/2006/02/18/auto-login
Then consider removing login links from notifications of new responses
Matthew says - only set session cookie first time, not each request

Screen scrape this and add link to it on the public body page
http://www.ico.gov.uk/Home/tools_and_resources/decision_notices.aspx

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

XXX do we need specifically that text, is it better than "Freedom of Information Request" which we put now?
