Sort my requests by when activity last happened to them?

Grrr - so here I wanted to clarify my request, but don't want the timer to be reset!
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/online_petitions_documents_from#incoming-3248

Hide quoted sections shouldn't put ? at end of URL, as then link to this refreshes
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/rspb_and_defra?#incoming-3104

Check where it sends messages to - why didn't thanks go direc to  Mitchell, Marilyn?

.zip file extensions

"Then you will be emailed whenever 'Martin Stabe' requests something or gets a
response" doesn't word wrap in confirmation email, and no full stop.

Reply links should probably link to form rather than message
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/4/response/866#show_response_followup

Email subjects badly escaped
Subject: Confirm you want to be emailed about requests to 'HM Revenue &amp; Customs'

Don't unnecessarily show email me twice if only request hits
e.g. http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/search/phorm

Comments interleaved with body
    - Add basic tests for comment controller

    - Test email alerts for comments
    - Email people subscribed to people about new comments that they make
      ... and likewise to requests, public bodies

    - Email people when comments on their own request
    - Email people when responses to their own comment, or warn them they need to sign up

    - Flag bad comments
    - Delete comments from admin interface

    - Test spell checker
    - Don't allow double posting
    - Check CSS class/id names used in all comment HTML
    - Think about the "nonsense" text a lot more

http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/communications_about_whatdotheyk
    Mask all emails from binary attachments

Internal review status/marker?

    (search for it!)
Request withdrawn by user status/marker?

Do something about shared spreadsheet

user/show.rhtml sidebar vs. generic sidebar? (ask Tommy)
There is grey on grey text in header? bad idea?

Make it clearer people should ask for documents
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/unusual_markings_in_the_uk_skies

Clear out all the need admin attention requests
Clear out all the need classifying requests

Admin:
Have internal links to different parts of request page
Somehow fold up the enormous pages on many admin pages
Make it easy to go from pages to admin page

Later
=====

From an email, isn't stripping spaces right.
    "Met Office  sent a response to Andrew Montford (14 August 2008)"
Also should group by the request id for search queries (so all appear
together when request and response mention same term)

This doesn't work:
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/search/status:waiting_classification/

Link the overdue date to an explanation of what bank holidays it skipped etc.
:)

When indexing .docx do you need to index docProps/custom.xml and docProps/app.xml
as well as word/document.xml ? (thread on xapian-discuss does so)

Something to check which tags are used but aren't in PublicBody category lists

When described state is edited in admin interface, automatically reset the flag
for needs classification.

Public body tags should perhaps be lowercase only :)

.tif files are hard for people to view as multi page, consider automatically
separating out the pages as separate links (to .png files or whatever)
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/windsor_maidenhead_council_commo#incoming-1910
Heck, may as well give thumbnails of all images, indeed all docs while you're at it :)

In sidebar of request 
    Share this request on Facebook, by email etc.
    Email icon here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/apr/03/mugabe
    Simple Digg style "I lke this request" button (doesn't tracking do?)
Show list of popular tracks somewhere (finds most popular requests in a way)

Advertise WDTK search queries on TWFY
Advertise alerts on end pages with WDTK

Blog posts / Wikipedia articles about this request
    e.g. http://socialreporter.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/costs-of-the-bbc-action-action-network/
    http://reportr.net/2008/04/24/bbc-spent-6m-to-develop-the-iplayer/
Or just look at referrers as Julian says

Alert you when someone you're tracking starts tracking another request

Catch query parser error, e.g. for this query
    water NOT NEAR "water lane"
Document such errors in acts_as_xapian

It's looking very nice!  I had a look at the M27 request, as per your
earlier email, but I was a bit thrown by the date - is it the 27th
today, or last week, or more recently.  Do you think it would be
worthwhile appending "($days days ago)" to the date of each message,
and "($days days to go)" to the due dates?  Saves people having to
work out (in their heads or otherwise) how long they need to wait for
a response. (Etienne) Use distance_of_time_in_words to do this

Maybe set it up to email team@ website errors?

Renaming public authorities will break alerts on them.

Compress the emails in the database

Display current page (when not on first page), or perhaps range on both the
/list pages, and on the /..../similar pages (maybe I missed it elsewhere too).
Should make a general will_paginate like function to do this part, and call
that from /search (which has this already) too.

Check this again after a while, for dodgy states of events:
s = InfoRequest.find(:all).select { |i| (not i.awaiting_description) and i.get_last_response_event_id and InfoRequestEvent.find(i.get_last_response_event_id).calculated_state != i.described_state }; s.size
- XXXX so when somebody changes waiting description without changing described state doesn't log in event.

Edits to outgoing/incoming/title won't be reindexed in Xapian (maybe just reindex all once a week)
And maybe edits to prominence, which is more upsetting
Never updates cached attachment text unless cache is explicitly cleared (which
might matter with software updates, or code changes)

Get Atom highlighting to include stylesheet for yellow somehow
Offer option of one RSS feed with all things you are tracking in it. Maybe.

"Some of the information" option should give you choice of complaining if you like.

Offer search on 404s

Preview when sending followups - especially people need to see quoting/subject
Spell checking for followups
For followups, have radio button to say is it a new request or followup?

Interface for when you change your email address - easier to do now with post_redirect.circumstance?

Tell application developer if working days table not up to date, and needs
updating

Synthesise these tips into our handful of snappy snappy bullet points
    http://community.foe.co.uk/tools/right_to_know/tips.html
    http://www.justice.gov.uk/requestinginformation.htm

Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses, now we have remember me

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Properly escape all name_and_email functions

Including 'Request for information' in the subject line of your e-mail will assist us in prioritising your request.
http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/freedom_of_information_in_the_house_of_lords/lords__foi___how_to_obtain_information.cfm
XXX do we need specifically that text, is it better than "Freedom of Information request" which we put now?
Medway also hint at this with subject= on mailto link

Remove request email address from PDFs (we already do from docs)
   http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cost_of_policing_the_oxford_unio_3
   - maybe if text contains email, refuse to show full PDF just show conversion
     to text/HTML?

Larger new features
-------------------

Antispam on contact form

Find a way to get corrected email addresses from responses - somehow getting
user to send them in?  
e.g. as in http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/1071/response/1870 which
we found largely by accident.

Rate limit requests using Ratty, with a freeze thing WTT-style, to detect
vexatious requests.

Merge workflow into one stream - find information, if you can't find it then request it.
    so just search is on front page, with popular stuff below a la Google Directory
Shamefully your incremental search, make it as nice as Matthew's i.e. 
    - have actual space in layout for full list rather than pop down.
    - show things beginning with the term first, separated visually
    - highlight the parts which match
Google search within website of authority.
Show similar requests after you have filed yours - maybe on preview too.
Use spelling correction for public bodies search (in addition to substring?)

Editable user profile, including photo upload

Show documents inline (word docs etc.)
Julian's PDF excerpting thing for highlighting paragraphs
   and convert Word Docs to PDFs too

Add geographical location to council import
Have a single button to sign up to alerts on all your council PCTs etc.

Holding pen with comments - new requests don't get sent straight away, but are
    delayed while people help improve them.

Screen scrape this and add link to it on the public body page
http://www.ico.gov.uk/Home/tools_and_resources/decision_notices.aspx

Description for each body as to what info it holds
Link to:
    Aliases (not just short name, but multiple real names e.g. for museums)
    Disclosure logs
    Publication schemes (http://www.ico.gov.uk/what_we_cover/freedom_of_information/publication_schemes.aspx)
    TWFY department search
    Complaint email
e.g.
    http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/index.html
    http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/coiindex.html

Give hotline to call body for extra help
e.g. Advice and assistance in making FoI requests to the House of Lords is available
from the Freedom of Information Officer, Parliamentary Archives, House of
Lords. London SW1A 0PW. Telephone 020 7219 0100. E-mail: foilords@parliament.uk
http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/freedom_of_information_in_the_house_of_lords/lords__foi___how_to_obtain_information.cfm

EU regulation 1049/2001
US (with Sunlight)

Ask what they learnt from request, and other things?
    and reward by putting their request on front page

OCR all images automatically, even if badly (check for tiffs!)
Maybe use Scrbd's free service :) http://www.scribd.com/paper

Hyperlink Section 1(3) to the act
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/49/response/86
and to guidance notes
    http://www.ico.gov.uk/what_we_cover/freedom_of_information/guidance.aspx

Only show "is email right" footer the first time a new request is sent to that email?
Show public body email address on their public page, with a link to say "this isn't right!"
