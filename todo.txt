     I received a reply on 4 April from Alison McCarthy to my request for
information about a development grant (SIC Code 7220) to Vero International
Software UK Limited which is unfortunately not satisfactory.
    I requested all details about this grant in terms of its application and
any reports done afterwards.  In order to facilitate my understanding as to the
degree of accountability regarding this grants, I need to see all documents
held by the Regional Development Agency which could possibly provide evidence
that the project outlined actually existed, and that the money wasn't simply
absorbed into shareholder profit.
    It would be entirely fair to redact all trade secrets and confidential
information from the documents as they are disclosed, but I do not believe it
is reasonable to withhold disclosure of even their titles, dates and number of
pages.

Please send me all documentation relating to the decision to use results from
the Oxford Economic Forecasting's report "The Economic Contribution of the
Aviation Industry in the UK" in the "Air Transport White Paper Progress Report
 2006"

Blog posts / Wikipedia articles about this request
    e.g. http://socialreporter.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/costs-of-the-bbc-action-action-network/
    http://reportr.net/2008/04/24/bbc-spent-6m-to-develop-the-iplayer/
Or just look at referrers as Julian says

In sidebar of request 
    Share this request on Facebook, by email etc.
    Email icon here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/apr/03/mugabe
    Simple Digg style "I lke this request" button (doesn't tracking do?)

user/show.rhtml sidebar vs. generic sidebar? (ask Tommy)
Needs tagline that v. quickly explains what site is on each page

Later
=====

Renaming public authorities will break alerts on them.

Display current page (when not on first page), or perhaps range on both the
/list pages, and on the /..../similar pages (maybe I missed it elsewhere too).
Should make a general will_paginate like function to do this part, and call
that from /search (which has this already) too.

Check this again after a while, for dodgy states of events:
s = InfoRequest.find(:all).select { |i| (not i.awaiting_description) and i.get_last_response_event_id and InfoRequestEvent.find(i.get_last_response_event_id).calculated_state != i.described_state }; s.size
- XXXX so when somebody changes waiting description without changing described state doesn't log in event.

Museum aliases

Edits to outgoing/incoming/title won't be reindexed in Xapian (maybe just reindex all once a week)
Never update cached attachment text unless cache is explicitly cleared

Link more clearly to full request and next/previous correspondence (ask Matthew)
    Perhaps always redirect to internal # links from the /response/ pages
e.g. http://www.flickr.com/groups/central/discuss/72157604494352123/72157604515433851/

Get Atom highlighting to include stylesheet for yellow somehow
When you click RSS feed when on own request, default to RSS in the choice on next page
Offer option of a feed with the union of all your feeds (tartarus asked for this).

"Some of the information" option should give you choice of complaining if you like.

Offer search on 404s

Preview when sending followups - especially people need to see quoting/subject
When sending "my response is late"

Interface for when you change your email address - easier to do now with post_redirect.circumstance?

One of the PDFs on live site has:
Error: PDF version 1.6 -- xpdf supports version 1.5 (continuing anyway)
Need to upgrade to poppler-utils?
Check that it now shows editor fine

Merge workflow into one stream - find information, if you can't find it then request it.
    so just search is on front page, with popular stuff below a la Google Directory
Use spelling correction for public bodies search?

Tell application developer if working days table not up to date, and needs
updating

Synthesise these tips into our handful of snappy snappy bullet points

    http://www.justice.gov.uk/requestinginformation.htm

Only show "is email right" footer the first time a new request is sent to that
email?
Show public body email address on their public page, with a link to say "this isn't right!"

Allow searching of authorities by tag
CSV export of lists of emails for admins

Show list of popular tracks somewhere (finds most popular requests in a way)

Remember me box
    This can't possible be the best way, it is too depressing:
    http://onrails.org/articles/2006/02/18/auto-login
Then consider removing login links from notifications of new responses
Matthew says - only set session cookie first time, not each request

Screen scrape this and add link to it on the public body page

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

XXX do we need specifically that text, is it better than "Freedom of Information Request" which we put now?
